## Description
This is a current weather and five day weather forecast. When you search for the city you will get a selection of different cities that you can choose from. The page will geocode and search for the weather data once the city is chosen and populate both the current weather and five day forecast.

I have been having trouble with the five day forecast and will continue to adjusting the functionality.
